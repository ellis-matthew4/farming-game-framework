# Abstract

This project exists to serve as a base for farming games such as Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley. By removing the effort of writing out base mechanics that will generally exist universally across these projects, the goal is to make the process of creating such a game easier, and by extension, make it a more pleasant development experience.
